## Meeting 03 July 2023

* The new contract syntax is not relevant for us: they just changing the contract syntax to make it belong to the 
function signature. But, we are interested in the contract content.

* The content of the contract block is “extendable”. There is some code prototype written in the past.

* Currently, the compiler’s API reason locally. There are plans for having a global API for reading with modules, then 
having a *global analysis*. For now, we can limit ourselves with local information.

* For quick start: Ilya suggests to fork the Kotlin language repository
into a private repository. The folder `plugins` contains current implementation of several bundled plugins. 
We can start looking in [`noarg`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/plugins/noarg) and 
[`allopen`](https://github.com/JetBrains/kotlin/tree/master/plugins/allopen). We should look in the structure of 
**K2** plugins.

* For the plugin we should give a look on `{*}Checker` classes. The checkers are run after the full resolution of code.
And they are responsible to issue diagnostic.
