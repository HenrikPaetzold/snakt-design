This document aims to illustrates what are the errors generated by Viper.

We start disntuishing two types of errors:

1. **Consistency Errors**: what is wrong according to the semantic of a Viper program (e.g., bad-formed method invocation,
access predicates, ...).

2. **Verification Errors**: generated by Viper during the verification process.

## Verification Errors

This section reports the errors generated by Viper during the verification process. The complete lists of generated 
errors can be found [here](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/blob/07dce2bf8a90f6be9443ece6d1697b0e2767fb48/src/main/scala/viper/silver/verifier/VerificationError.scala).

In our test suite for bad contracts we get three errors:

1. `PostconditionViolated`
2. `PreconditionInCallFalse`
3. `AssertFailed`

Each one of these errors bring with them seevral information, illustrated in a table below.

| Error Kind                	| Reason         	| Offending Node        	| Member 	| Context                                	|
|---------------------------	|----------------	|-----------------------	|--------	|----------------------------------------	|
| `PostconditionViolated`   	| AssertionFalse 	| Postcondition         	| Method 	| Conditional Effect, Calls in Place     	|
| `PreconditionInCallFalse` 	| AssertionFalse 	| Call-site of a method 	| /      	| Calls in Place Leaking, List Functions 	|
| `AssertFailed`            	| AssertionFalse 	| Assert Statement      	| /      	| Calls in Place Leaking                 	|

Each error generated by Viper brings three main information:

1.  The kind of error: this is obtained by the error instance's type at runtime.
2.  The reason: why the error was geenrated. This information, mainly of type `AssertionFalse`, has two main fields: an 
    identifier and the `offendingNode` (who caused the error). The list of reasons can be found [here](https://github.com/viperproject/silver/blob/ce5523d0c902f5ff61c8af49f80cd180f758c5b5/src/main/scala/viper/silver/verifier/VerificationError.scala#L591).
3.  The offending node: where the error generated from the verification process. Notice that this information may be
    different from the one embedded into reason.
